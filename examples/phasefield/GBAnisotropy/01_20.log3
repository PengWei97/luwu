*** Info ***
/home/pw-moose/projects/luwu/examples/phasefield/GBAnisotropy/GBAnisotropic_10.i:43: (UserObjects/voronoi/coloring_algorithm):
    The backtracking algorithm has exponential complexity. If you are using very few order parameters,
    or you have several hundred grains or more, you should use one of the PETSc coloring algorithms such as "jp".[39m
